# BitsoUI

A mini Design System to be used across all modules in the app.

## Component

Provides basic reusable components:

- [NoticeView](./Sources/Component/Notice) displays a notice with a title and a message.
- [CardView](./Sources/Component/CardView.swift) wraps other content into a card-like view
- [IconView](./Sources/Component/IconView.swift) displays a system icon

## Constants

Provides several constants to avoid using literal values:

- [Border](./Sources/Constants/Border.swift) constants to manage the borders of a view
- [Icon](./Sources/Constants/Icon.swift) constants to create and resize icons
- [Spacing](./Sources/Constants/Spacing) provides basic spacing values and utils to allows views to interact with them
